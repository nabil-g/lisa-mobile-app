# lisa-mobile-app
Mobile hybrid app client for Lisa.

This is a work in progress. Don't expect too much features :).

This hybrid application is primarily made to be compiled through Cordova, but it can also work in the browser.

It serves as a client for the Lisa home server (work in progress not available on GitHub yet).

#### Requirements

Node.js >= 6.10.3
npm >= 3.10.10

Before building with Gulp, don't forget to install node modules.

```sh
npm install
```
